# Retrospective Summary - Epic 4: Discovery & Organization

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Project:** prompt-repo
**Epic:** 4 - Discovery & Organization

## Overview
This retrospective covers the final implementation phase of the PromptRepo MVP, focusing on search, organization, and UI density.

## Delivery Metrics
- **Stories Completed:** 4/4 (100%)
- **Search Performance:** < 50ms (Target: < 100ms)
- **UI Resilience:** Fully functional at 400px width.
- **Quality:** 92/92 tests passing.

## Successes & Strengths
- **Command Palette (4.2):** Successfully implemented a keyboard-first global search that feels instantaneous.
- **Search Engine (4.1):** Leveraged PostgreSQL `tsvector` for high-performance indexing.
- **Collections (4.3):** Delivered a secure, multi-tenant organizational system with RLS protection.
- **UI Density (4.4):** Achieved a professional "sidecar" layout optimized for 400px viewports.

## Challenges & Growth Areas
- **Density Balance:** Ensuring legibility (12px floor) while maintaining high density in narrow viewports was a significant balancing act.
- **Responsive Testing:** Initial development lacked rigorous 400px verification, which was corrected during senior review.

## Key Insights
1. **Interaction-Driven Value:** High-velocity keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K) define the product's utility.
2. **Constraint-Based Design:** 'Sidebar-first' isn't just a breakpoint; it's a primary design constraint that prevents 'desktop-only' bloat.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Standardized Viewport Testing:** Add explicit 400px verification to all future story ACs. (Owner: Dana)
- [ ] **Performance Baseline:** Document sub-100ms search benchmarks for future regression testing. (Owner: Charlie)
- [ ] **Launch Guide:** Create a user-facing guide for keyboard shortcuts. (Owner: Elena)

## Readiness Assessment
- **Quality:** Production-ready.
- **Security:** RLS isolation verified.
- **Performance:** Met and exceeded all PRD targets.
- **Stakeholder Acceptance:** "All Perfect" (per Project Lead pedroid).

## Final Commitment
The MVP implementation phase is considered **DONE**. The team is ready for production launch and subsequent Phase 2 planning.
